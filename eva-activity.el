;;; Commentary:

;; You may notice there's no code.  Until we make more specific functionality
;; for activity prediction, it makes sense to keep what we have in a section of
;; eva-builtin.

;;; Code:

(require 'eva)

(provide 'eva-activity)

;; Local Variables:
;; nameless-current-name: "eva"
;; End:

;;; eva-activity.el ends here
